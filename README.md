---

#### **Property**
- `id`: Unique identifier for the property
- `owner_id`: Foreign key to the user who listed the property
- `title`: Title of the property listing
- `description`: Detailed description of the property
- `location`: Address or city name

**Relationships**:
- A property belongs to **one user (owner)**
- A property can have **many bookings**
- A property can have **many reviews**

---

#### **Booking**
- `id`: Unique identifier for the booking
- `user_id`: Foreign key to the user who made the booking
- `property_id`: Foreign key to the booked property
- `check_in`: Start date of the stay
- `check_out`: End date of the stay

**Relationships**:
- A booking is made by **one user**
- A booking is for **one property**
- A booking can be linked to **one payment**

---

#### **Review**
- `id`: Unique identifier for the review
- `user_id`: Foreign key to the reviewer
- `property_id`: Foreign key to the reviewed property
- `rating`: Numeric score (e.g., 1 to 5)
- `comment`: Text feedback from the user

**Relationships**:
- A review is written by **one user**
- A review is about **one property**

---

#### **Payment**
- `id`: Unique identifier for the payment
- `booking_id`: Foreign key to the associated booking
- `amount`: Total amount paid
- `payment_method`: e.g., credit card, PayPal
- `status`: e.g., paid, pending, failed

**Relationships**:
- A payment is linked to **one booking**


## Feature Breakdown

### 1. User Management
This feature enables users to create accounts, authenticate securely, and manage their personal profiles. It supports role-based access control (e.g., host vs. guest) and forms the basis of all user-related interactions across the platform.

### 2. Property Management
Hosts can create, update, and delete property listings. Each listing includes essential information such as title, description, price, location, and availability. This allows hosts to manage their offerings efficiently and keep listings up to date.

### 3. Booking System
Registered users can browse properties and make reservations by selecting available dates. The booking system handles check-in/check-out logic, prevents overlapping bookings, and allows users to track their reservation history.

### 4. Payment Processing
Secure and reliable payment handling is integrated using trusted third-party providers. The system ensures that bookings are paid for through encrypted transactions, with support for common payment methods and real-time payment status updates.

### 5. Review System
After completing a stay, guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties. This feature encourages community feedback, improves host accountability, and helps future users make informed decisions based on previous experiences.

### 6. API Access (REST and GraphQL)
The backend supports both RESTful APIs and GraphQL queries. This enables flexible, efficient access to the platform’s functionality for frontend interfaces, mobile applications, and potential third-party integrations.

### 7. Performance Optimization
To ensure scalability and responsiveness, the backend uses techniques such as database indexing, query optimization, caching (with Redis), and asynchronous background processing (with Celery). These measures reduce latency and improve overall performance under load.

## API Security

Ensuring strong API security is vital for protecting sensitive data, preventing unauthorized access, and maintaining user trust. The following measures will be implemented throughout the project to safeguard user information, booking data, and payment processes:

- **Authentication:**
  Only registered users will be allowed to access protected endpoints using secure authentication mechanisms (e.g., token-based authentication like JWT). This prevents anonymous or malicious access to user accounts and platform features.

- **Authorization:**
  Authorization rules will ensure users can only perform actions they are permitted to (e.g., only a property owner can edit their property). This prevents users from modifying or accessing data that does not belong to them.

- **Rate Limiting:**
  Rate limiting will be implemented to prevent abuse of the API by limiting the number of requests a user or IP address can make in a certain timeframe. This helps protect the backend from brute-force attacks and denial-of-service attempts.

- **Data Encryption:**
  Sensitive data such as passwords and payment details will be securely encrypted using industry-standard practices (e.g., hashing passwords with PBKDF2 or bcrypt). This protects user credentials and financial data in case of a breach.

- **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
  All incoming data will be validated and sanitized to prevent common attacks such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS). Proper input handling ensures the integrity and safety of the application and its users.

- **Secure Payment Handling:**
  Payment transactions will be processed through trusted third-party gateways such as Stripe or PayPal. These services provide built-in compliance with security standards like PCI DSS, ensuring safe financial operations.

Security practices will be continuously reviewed and updated to adapt to new threats, following industry standards and OWASP recommendations.

## CI/CD Pipeline

CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) is a set of automated processes that allow developers to integrate code changes, run tests, and deploy applications efficiently and reliably.

Implementing CI/CD pipelines helps ensure:
- Every code change is automatically tested before being merged.
- Deployment to staging or production environments happens quickly and with minimal manual effort.
- Bugs are detected early in the development lifecycle.
- Teams can deliver features faster with higher confidence and stability.

### Tools Used

To support CI/CD in this project, the following tools and services will be used:

- **GitHub Actions**: Automates workflows such as running tests, linting code, and deploying when new changes are pushed to the repository.
- **Docker**: Provides a consistent environment for development, testing, and deployment by containerizing the application.
- **Docker Hub** or **GitHub Container Registry**: Stores Docker images used in deployments.
- **(Optional) Heroku / Railway / AWS / DigitalOcean**: Hosting platforms that may be used for deploying the backend application.

As the project evolves, additional stages like security checks, performance testing, and database migrations may be included in the pipeline.
